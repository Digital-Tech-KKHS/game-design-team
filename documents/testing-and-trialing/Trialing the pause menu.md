## Results
> - Charley found that the "Quit to menu" option was better as it mimicked other games' pause menus. 
> - Charley found that the "Quit" option made less sense as he found it was important that the game should take you back to the menu in case you wanted to change graphical fidelity options.

## Briefly describe the changes you have made based on this trial
> - Initially, the quit button was programmed to quit the game. This was changed to quit to menu.
