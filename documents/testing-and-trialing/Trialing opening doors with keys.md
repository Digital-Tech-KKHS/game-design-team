Involved in the trial
>- Charley Cates
## Trial goal:
> To ensure that the game would allow the user to unlock the door, given they had the correct key

## Describe the trial
> I loaded the game and scattered keys throughout the map and loaded a map where only the one key was visible, that being only the correct key

(No photos can be supplied)
## Results
> - Charley easily found the only key in the level where there was only one key and could easily complete the game.
> - Charley found the map where the keys were scattered more challenging as it forced the user to explore every room and take their chances to go to the next room.
> - A bug was found where sometimes I forgot to change the time to open the door to a time that wasn't 0, therefore the door wouldn't open and just play the sound instead.

## Briefly describe the changes you have made based on this trial
> - Changed the variable to 0.5 secs to open the door so it will actually open
