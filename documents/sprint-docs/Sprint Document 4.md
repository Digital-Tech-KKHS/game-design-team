# Sprint Summary

## **Sprint Reflection and summary**
During this time, it really was crunch time and a lot of things that I needed to do, needed to be done. Everything that was done was all covered in the kanban board. However, I did run into many issues throughout this crunch time. A big issue I faced was memory leaks and the datasmith plugin simply not importing my project into the Unreal Engine. I did manage to fix both of these problems with one solution and that was decreasing the scope of the project. I realised my project was getting out of control and I needed to cut down on the assets I was using otherwise my game was going to be over 50GB which isn't right for a game of this scope. During this time I also faced issues with GitHub as my project became too large and Git LFS could no longer handle the project scope forcing me to reduce the size of the project as well. Another problem I faced was heavy performance issues due to my dynamic lighting scenery inside the asylum causing the game to not run at an acceptable framerate as a result. I fixed this issue by making sure I changed the lighting from dynamic lighting to precalculated, static lighting. I still face the issue in the main menu screen where the options menu does not actually save the users settings and if I did have more time, this would have been done and fixed, however, I am unable to fix this issue as I needed to focus on more game mechanics.
