# Sprint Summary

## **Sprint Reflection and summary:**
During this time, I still hadn't fully figured out my scenery and I wasn't entirely sure the direction this game was going to go as my game design document wasn't helping all that much. I ran into complications that had to be solved such as modelling the scenery. The scenery had to be modelled in Autodesk Revit as I needed a place to model architecture. This could then be exported from Revit to the unreal engine which was thankfully painless. During this time, not a lot of programming was happening, mainly because I wanted to fully sort the scenery before I set out on implementing mechanics. During this time, my game setting was decided as well, I decided on the setting of the asylum, as opposed to the setting of a forest. With the asylum, the level could be made more interesting and didn't require too much detail to have a proper level.
