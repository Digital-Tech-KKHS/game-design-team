# Sprint Summary

## **Sprint Reflection and summary:**
During this time, I still hadn't fully figured out my scenery and I wasn't entirely sure the direction this game was going to go as my game design document wasn't helping all that much. I ran into complications that had to be solved such as modelling the scenery. The scenery had to be modelled in Autodesk Revit as I needed a place to model architecture. This could then be exported from Revit to the unreal engine which was thankfully painless. During this time, not a lot of programming was happening, mainly because I wanted to fully sort the scenery before I set out on implementing mechanics. During this time, my game setting was decided as well, I decided on the setting of the asylum, as opposed to the setting of a forest. With the asylum, the level could be made more interesting and didn't require too much detail to have a proper level. 
## **Major Changes and Achievements Described**
- Decided on changing level theme to asylum
- Figured out how to use the datasmith plugin properly
- Switched setting from forest to an asylum setting
- Began modelling building for use in unreal
- Gave player a flashlight
## **Brief Description of your testing**
- Forest scene was placed in front of play testers and found the world boring.
- Forest scene was scraped in favour of an asylum scene.
- Forest scene presented issues such as poor framerates and collision issues.

## **Notes for next time, future improvements**
I would like to make sure that I get the entire bottom story finished and start implementing game mechanics for the next sprint. I feel like I'm a little behind in this sprint so I would like to use next sprint to catch up on the work that I did not do. A future improvement is finishing the building and adding the enemies for the game.
