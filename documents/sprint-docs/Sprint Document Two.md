# Sprint Summary

## **Sprint Reflection and summary:**
For this sprint, I felt like I needed to make advances much further than ones that I had made. During this time, I spent a lot of time and resources figuring out how to incorporate the main menu screen and getting the play button to work. It proved to be a challenge as the play button just wouldn't load the level. I attempted to make the button work and eventually did as it required a work around that was not discoverable online and was only discovered through trial and error.

## **Briefly describe other team members contributions:**

## **Major Changes and Achievements Described:**
The major achievement for this sprint was definitely getting the main menu screen to display and to work and function correctly. With this main menu, I was able to get an options menu and a play button working as well as these were mechanics that I would like to see in my real game. The resolution switcher will prove to be useful, especially during the end product when I want this game to run on lower end hardware so I can broaden my audience. 

## **Brief Description of your testing:**
The main portion of the testing was spent figuring out the main menu and getting the play button to work. I tested it mainly myself as I believe such a simple mechanic doesn't require much testing from someone other than myself. The main menu was also put through its paces and tested as well to ensure that there were no bugs present, and thankfully through my methods of testing, there were no bugs to be seen.

## **Notes for next time, future improvements:**
I would like to see the game add the scroll feature in my Kanban board as this is an essential mechanic in the end game. I would also like to see the performance improved drastically. This can be improved by the end of the game when I go to cook it. I can compile the game down to C++ later on and run it that way. A flashlight mechanic is also a future improvement I'd like to see.
