# Sprint Summary
## **Sprint Reflection and summary:**
During this time, I don't believe I did a lot of work and felt relatively unmotivated to finish this project due to the massive climb I had ahead of me when it came to designing the game. Mechanics such as collisions with the object I'm standing on were easily taken care of thankfully and gave me the motivation I needed to continue the project.

## **Major Changes and Achievements Described:**
A scene with objects that could be stood on and collided with were the major achievements of this sprint and overall, creating a playable character was also a major achievement. 

## **Brief Description of your testing**
I had a friend of mine test the game and its mechanics to see if any bugs could be exploited, and thanks to the simplicity of the game, no bugs could be found in the current state of the game. An issue that my friend had with the game was that there currently wasn't a win condition, and if you fell off the platforms, the game had to be restarted as there was no lose condition. A mechanic I wish to add at the end of the sprint.

## **Notes for next time, future improvements:**
I would like to finish this MVP project and move onto the real game eventually. A scroll collectable still needs to be added and I would also like to maybe trial opening and closing doors as well as interacting with other.
