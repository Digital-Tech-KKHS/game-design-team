# Theme and setting

Cubical Odyssey is a 3D action puzzle game that is set in an unknown location, similar to a haunted house. The player gets to know their faceless character through discovering the story through left behind items and notes by previous people that tried to escape, but ultimately fell victim to the horrors of the house. The setting is fictional and may feature otherworldly elements such as NPC ghosts that guide you and collectables such as scrolls.

# Success Criteria
Considering your intended audience and the objectives of your game come up with 5 or more criteria that you will use to determine if your game has been successful. 
What evidence will you use to measure each criteria? 
|     | Criteria              | Evidence                                                                                                                                                                           |
| --- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Enjoyable             | Going to conduct an exit survey to ask if the game was enjoyable and would like to have an honest opinion on this topic so I would like to survey reliable people                  |
| 2   | Technical Performance | Going to test the game throughout the development cycle for any hitches, lag spikes or another undesirable performance metrics that can make the game unplayable                   |
| 3   | Replay value          | Going to conduct an exit survey again to ask of the users would like to replay the game or if the game is worth replaying                                                          |
| 4   | Art                   | Before gameplay, I will ask the users to comment on the look and feel of the art style and if any changes to the art style would be appropriate.                                   |
| 5   | Ease Of Use           | During gameplay, I will survey the user and get them to comment on the ease of the U.I and the ease of use of the game and if the controls are easy to learn and feel appropriate. |

# Game Setting

The game is set in a haunted house where a local, faceless character is trapped and needs to find a way out before his time is up and he needs the users help.

## The Haunted House
General description

The haunted house was a place built during the 1700's for a family of four that abruptly moved out after a mysterious event disturbed the previous owners. The place is riddled with scrolls, pieces of the story that are left over due to the quick and swift abandonment. The collectables can be discovered by searching through rooms of a bygone era and hallways filled with puzzles and challenges that the user has to overcome. These puzzles and other collectables give hints towards the story and the backstory to the character the user is playing. The house is located by itself in the middle of nowhere.

# Story

## Backstory 

The Haunted House is a place full of mysteries which need to be found by the user. The original owners of the home where the first and last for a very long time. They were forced out of their home due to an unknown, compelling force that they were unable to overcome, forced them out of their beloved home before they disappeared mysteriously and were never to be seen again. The player needs to piece together their mystery to find out what happened to this family before it is too late and they meet the same fate. Many have tried, but all in all, the theme ultimately remains constant and the house claims all lives. Can you be the only one to escape the house?

# Characters

## The Protagonist
 Backstory: A character that the player must connect with and name in the beginning. The player needs to learn more and understand the unknown player through discovery of scrolls and other left behind items as well as talking to the interactable NPC's that the player will encounter through the game. Slowly over time the player will discover that they're the villain

 Personality: A faceless character, white and has a similar appearance to that of a person

## Supporting Character #2

# Gameplay

## Movement
How is your player going to move? Do they respond to gravity? How is the user controlling them?

The player can be controlled through the WASD keys, the mouse, arrow keys and other controls such as E for interaction. The player also responds to gravity and can interact with most of the playable world.

## Objects
What things exist in your world? Are there collectables, keys, spikes or moveable blocks?

Most of the objects throughout the world are interactable because the player needs to shift around items in the playable world in order to solve the puzzles. Scrolls and other collectables are allowed to be collected and read on collection.

## Actions
What does your player do? Do they interact with anything? If so, what and how?

My player can interact with the world, collect scrolls and other things such as open doors and move furniture around to solve puzzles and complete the level to move onto the next room.

## Combat
Are there enemies in your game? How do they move? How do they hurt the player? How does the player overcome them? Do they respond to the player or simply act in a predefined way?

There will be enemies in the game, however, the player cannot fight or perform combat actions as they're a neutral character without the ability to fight. Combat can be resolved by simply solving the puzzle without dying and moving on to the next room and the conflict can be resolved.

## Talking
Do your characters communicate? Is it through audio or text? What key plot elements are represented through dialogue?

My character does not have the ability to talk and their story is simply told through scrolls and other collectables that the player can collect. There will be no dialogue and simply text communication. The backstory to the character is presented through the discovery of scrolls and other collectables that tell the story.


## UI elements
How does the player know what is going on in the game? What key aspects of the state of the game need to be communicated to the player? Is there a menu or an inventory? Is there a tutorial? How will the player know how to interact with your game? 

The player knows what is going on in the game because the storyline will be very linear and guiding the whole time while maintaining an element of mysteriousness. The key aspects of the game will be communicated to the player through certain collectables and other readables and items that will be found in a room. There is no inventory and the player will rely solely on a torch that they can enable by pressing 'F'. There will be a brief tutorial by telling the player how to interact with objects, move the character and turn the flashlight on as well as what they need to do in order to move onto the next level. However, I understand how frustrating tutorials are, and the tutorial will be optional. The player will be taught how to interact with the game through the games optional tutorial.

# Technical Requirements
## Required Technologies
How will your project be developed, what language will you use, what libraries will  you include. What attributes do these tools have that make it suitable 
for using in your project. 
What requirements will your end user have to run the game? How will you distribute it to them? 

The project will be developed in the unreal engine using a mix of the blueprint language and C++. The libraries will be provided by the unreal engine and other assets that aren't provided will be made using the unreal engine's asset editor. Unreal Engine provides me with everything I need as it provides a built-in asset editor. The game will require at least a GTX 460 graphics card and an Intel Core i5 2400 or AMD FX-8350 with a minimum of 4GB of RAM. The recommended requirements will be at least a GTX 760 or Radeon RX470, an Intel Core i7 2600 or AMD FX-9590 with a recommended 8GB of RAM. The game will be distributed using GitHub.
