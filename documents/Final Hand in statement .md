**Final Testing**

Please describe how you know your final game works

> First the player is spawned into a room full of beds after pressing the play button. The player must search through the rooms upstairs to find the correct key to unlock the door that sits on a wall that is at or near a 45Â° angle. This will open the door to the stairs that will take you to the bottom floor. Downstairs, the player will find another lady of the asylum that they must evade in order to escape the asylum. The player must search the downstairs area in order to find the right key to open the door that is located on the right side (relative to the staircase) of the asylum. The player can then open that door and make their way to the hole in the fence and escape the asylum. 

**Authenticity Statement**

Other than using tutorials and example code, all this work is my own. I understand all of the code and can explain it. Every commit made from my account was made by me.
